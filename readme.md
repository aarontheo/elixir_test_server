## Overview

**Project Title**: test_server (Elixir Map Storage Server)

**Project Description**: A simple Elixir client/server setup which allows the user to type simple database commands: put, get, delete, and keys, which will get, store, and delete data in key/value pairs in the server's state.

**Project Goals**:
Learn the basic Elixir syntax and how it differs from Erlang and how to both create, build, and run an Elixir project using both iex, Elixir's REPL, and Mix, Elixir's project manager.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. cd into the project directory
2. run 'mix compile'
3. run 'mix run lib/run_program.exs'

Instructions for using the software:

1. In the interactive shell, the user can type various commands.
2. Typing 'help' will provide a list of available commands, and their usage.
3. There is an easter egg command, having to do with America's favorite type of hot sandwich. (ASCII art courtesy of ChatGPT)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Use Elixir's scripting and struct system to do things that are difficult with Erlang.
* [ ] Write more Elixir code, get a better feel for it
* [ ] Integrate my Erlang code with Elixir
